/**
 * =============================================================================
 * GAME LOGIC MODULE - Core Go Game Mechanics
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This module contains all the core game logic for the Go game including:
 * - Game state management
 * - Move validation and execution
 * - Capture detection and removal
 * - Board analysis functions
 * - Game ending conditions
 *
 * Key Concepts in Go:
 * - Stones: Black and white pieces placed on board intersections
 * - Groups: Connected stones of the same color
 * - Liberties: Empty adjacent points to a group
 * - Capture: Remove opponent groups with no liberties
 * - Ko Rule: Prevents immediate recapture (not implemented in this version)
 * - Suicide Rule: Cannot place stone that kills own group unless it captures
